# Linked-Lists-to-Implement-the-CellPhone-and-CellList-Classes-for-Managing-Cell-Phone-Records (Java)
implementation of two Java classes, the CellPhone class and the CellList inner class, for storing and manipulating records of cell phones. The CellPhone class represents a single cell phone and has attributes for the serial number, brand, year, and price. The class includes a parameterized constructor for initializing these attributes, a copy constructor for creating a copy of a CellPhone object with a new serial number, a clone method for creating a copy of the object with a user-specified serial number, a toString method for generating a string representation of the object, and an equals method for comparing two CellPhone objects based on their attributes. The CellList class uses a linked list data structure to store a list of CellPhone objects and has methods for adding, inserting, deleting, and replacing CellPhone objects, as well as methods for finding the minimum and maximum prices, the average price, and the index of a CellPhone object based on its serial number. The CellList class also includes a method for reading data from a file and creating a list of CellPhone objects.
